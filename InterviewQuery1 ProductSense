Improving and Innovating Products
 
Product ask for insignts... pull...  data build feature...lanunch /abtest .. measure sucess
problems 
Investigating Metrics:  Why is feature x dropping by y percent
Measuring Product Success:  analyzing the success of released features
Feature Change: Letâ€™s say we want to add/change/improve a new feature to product X
Metric Trade-offs: comments are down by 10% but reactions are up by 15%
want to grow metric: We want to grow x metric on y feature

Before interview: product research  understanding their product from a business perspective
General Framework: 
1. Clarifying the Question (goals,backkground)
2. Make Assumptions (narrow the scope)
3. Analyze User Flows (how the product works,different users)
4. Define Hypothesis (root cause of the issue)
5. Draw Metrics to Support your Hypothesis
6. Tie Your Analysis to the Product Goals (tie analysis back to the product goals)
7. Remember to talk out loud


Investigating Metrics: If X metric is up/down by Y percent, how would you investigate it?
General Framework: Clarification)(def), Gather Context (cut the data), Hypothesize for Probable Causes, Validation(solution)
                   MECE framework: breaking a problem down by creating a decision tree for issues and hypotheses
e.g. Friend Request Example (Friend Request -10%, inestigate)
          1 clarification: time frame:one time/recurance  seasonality   
                           external factor:  competitor launching
                           internal factor: bugs,feature release
                           metric definition
          2  Gathe Context: time frame? entire website traffic? feature release? 
          3 Hyphothesizing and Evaluation: e.g.new users be the ones making the most friend requests
                user(join date, Age, Sex, Location, Organic, Paid, Content,Geography,Platform )
                activity(tpt vs active,DAU, WAU, MAU,New vs Existing,User feature attribution,time spent,  DAU / MAU or WAU / MAU )
                Marketplace/Feature Attributes(e.g. Friend requests acceptance rate going down, Friend requests taking longer to be accepted, 
                                                    bugs,New feature cannibalizing the existing feature)
                                                    
                                                    
                 use flows (funnels):  users eventually get to friend requests by: ppl know, friends of friends, event attend users, tagged pictures
                              others: Emails that get clicked through, Organic search vs paid channels vs blogs, Other features on the platform
                 
                 bugs
