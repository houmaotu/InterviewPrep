types of questions:
Modeling Case Study:  evaluate and explain a particular part of the model building process
Recommendation and Search Engines
Machine Learning Algorithm Concepts

Applied Modeling:  take machine learning concepts and ask how they could be applied to fix a certain problem
              Data Exploration & Pre-Processing
              Feature Selection & Engineering
              Model Selection
              Cross Validation
              Evaluation Metrics
              Testing and Roll Out
      Framework:
      Clarification(why this model, what's the use,how affwct bisuness, what matters accuracy?)
      Make Assumptions
      Define Priorities (build new/exist, user behavior, data set)
      Go through the modeling lifecycle
      
      Pre-Processing:   Outliers / Class Imbalance / Skewed Data / Missing Data
      Feature Selection: selecting good features /Variable Transformation /PCA /BINNING
